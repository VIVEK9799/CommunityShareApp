  Community Share App 
</h1>

A Flutter application for people to share their needs and offers within their community. Especially during a crisis, we realised how important it is for people to help each other. To help with that, the app highlights the urgent needs posted by its community members so that other members can help in a timely manner.

## Overview

### What's the problem?

Covid-19 has created new challenges and has impacted many lives.

Due to the covid-19 pandemic, Residents in local communities are unable to get essential items and there are no existing apps where they can seek help

What is needed is an application that allows members in communities to connect and help each other by posting needs and offering support.

----

## The Solution

The goal is to provide a cross-platform application that enables community cooperation to fight against challenges associated with pandemics.

It allows beneficiary people (people in need of essentials etc.) to post their needs (for example, "I am running out of rice. Has anyone got a spare bag of rice?") so that other community members can offer support. 

It also allows volunteer community members to donate/offer support by posting about what they would like to offer. Benefeciary people can accept the offer and receive support

----

## Implemented App interaction preview
