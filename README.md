## Overview

### What's the problem?

Covid-19 has created new challenges and has impacted many lives.

Due to the covid-19 pandemic, Residents in local communities are unable to get essential items and there are no existing apps where they can seek help

What is needed is an application that allows members in communities to connect and help each other by posting needs and offering support.

----

## The Solution

The goal is to provide a cross-platform application that enables community cooperation to fight against challenges associated with pandemics.

It allows beneficiary people (people in need of essentials etc.) to post their needs (for example, "I am running out of rice. Has anyone got a spare bag of rice?") so that other community members can offer support. 

It also allows volunteer community members to donate/offer support by posting about what they would like to offer. Benefeciary people can accept the offer and receive support

## How it works

A problem poster (who may be a normal individual, a small business owner or a large business) that is facing challenges due to COVID-19 (or any other global or community issue) posts the problem title, description and images/video of the problem using the mobile application or web application. He/she typically fills out a brief form that describes the problem. This information is then stored in a cloudant database in the IBM Cloud.

A problem solver/innovator, who believes in community cooperation and solving problems together, opens the mobile application and can browse/search the problems posted based on the individual's preferences. He/she picks a problem, draws sketches or takes a video and uploads the title, description and images/videos about the solution. Multiple innovators can submit solutions using the user interface as well as comment on other solutions. They can share solutions through social networks to encourage collaboration and attract feedback. The application also displays identified themes, top strong comments and word cloud for the review comments. 

The problem poster(small local business owner/any individual) can choose the best solution, implement the solution and post the outcomes. The business owner rewards the innovator who posted the best solution. Using Watson AI, other similar business owners will be notified about the problem, best solution and impact based on the similarities in the profile so that they can implement the same solution for their business.
